# APP DEVELOPMENT PLAN

1. Initialize new app.
2. Analyze problem and set the suitable environment.
3. Create skeleton of the solution.
4. Add tests based on documentation.
5. Describe algorithm and implement it.
6. Make some refactor until all the tests don't pass.
7. Cover validation from the backend perspective.
8. Make some design based on Materialize and Angular (a little bit excess of form for this task but why not).
9. Add live validation from the frontend perspective.
10. Add predefining jobs section.
11. Require the main section to use only the predefined jobs.
12. Deploy the result to heroku.
